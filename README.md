Creating mandala using the p5.js Web editor

So here's the deal, I actually don't know much in coding or p5.js and so I tried the basic design that has a limited codes and what the p5.js programming could produce. This pattern I made is the result of my "come what may" in my mind. So far so good, the result is better than I expected because I don't know how to draw a mandala. Mine's kind a simple.
If there was a face to face classes, I could have easily learn more about our subject in game development and especially in programming.
